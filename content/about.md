## Hi, welcome

I am a Western European Buddhist monk currently residing in a monastery in Northern India. This blog serves as my outlet to share reflections, insights, and observations through the lens of the Madhyamaka school of Buddhist philosophy.

## My Journey

My path to monasticism wasn't straightforward. With a background in science and technology, I also spent over a decade founding and volunteering with organizations focused on social issues. Buddhism entered my life gradually since childhood, but it wasn't until facing significant personal challenges that I fully committed to this path.

Now, as a full-time student at a Tibetan Monastic University, I'm documenting this journey—both the profound realizations and the everyday experiences of monastic life.

## Why Madhyamaka?

As someone with a scientifically-oriented mind, I found in the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) philosophy a rigorous approach to understanding reality that complemented and extended beyond what empirical science alone could offer. This school of thought, with its emphasis on avoiding extreme views and understanding emptiness, provides tools to examine both materialistic assumptions and spiritual claims.

The term "Madhyamaka" itself comes from Sanskrit: _madhya_ meaning "middle," _ma_ meaning "most," and _ka_ functioning as an adjective suffix.

## What To Expect

This blog will cover a diverse range of topics including:

- Buddhist philosophy and logic
- Experiences of Western monastic life in an Eastern tradition
- Translations of Mahayana texts and manuscripts
- Reflections on the intersection of science and spirituality
- Occasional poems and creative writing
- Personal observations on meditation practice

## Purpose

My intention is simple: to share perspectives that might otherwise remain inaccessible due to language, cultural, or financial barriers. I hope these writings serve as a bridge between traditional Buddhist scholarship and contemporary thinking.

I don't claim to be an authority — just a practitioner documenting his study and practice. Some posts will be scholarly, others personal. All are offered in the spirit of exploration rather than definitive answers.

Welcome to Middle Way Musings.
