Welcome to Middle Way Musings! Here, we explore the tapestry of reality through the "Middle Way" lens of Buddhism. Our musings go beyond definitive answers, serving as mental adventures that delve into Buddhism, science, and more.

So, who's behind these musings? It's me! With a background in science and technology, I've spent over a decade volunteering and founding organizations addressing social issues. Along the way, I've dabbled in Buddhadharma since 2012, but it wasn't until 2017 that I fully embraced the path. Now, as a full-time student in a Tibetan Monastic University, I'm excited to share the insights gained from this journey.

But why the fascination with Buddhism? As a scientifically inclined mind, I sought a deeper understanding of reality beyond what science alone could offer. That's where Mahayana Buddhism, particularly Madhyamaka i.e. the Middle Way [^1], entered the picture. It provided me with the tools to challenge materialistic views and bridge the gap between science and spirituality.

Through this blog, I aim to share the insights and understanding I gain on my journey through the hallowed halls of a Tibetan Monastic University. Expect a diverse array of topics, including philosophy, religion, monasticism, logic, reasoning, science, psychology, meditation, yoga, wisdom, compassion, and much more. I will also share translations of Mahayana texts and manuscripts, bringing ancient wisdom to light for the modern world.

What do I hope to achieve with all this? It's simple â€“ to offer you perspectives and views that may be otherwise inaccessible due to language, cultural, or financial barriers. I love to challenge existing perspectives, I believe it's important to expand our collective understanding.

So, dear reader, welcome to Middle Way Musings. Get ready to embark on journey of mind and spirit, where intellect and curiosity intertwine, and where profound insights mingle with lighthearted musings. Together, let us navigate the Middle Way, unveiling the wonders that lie in store.
